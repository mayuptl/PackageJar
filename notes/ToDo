1] Dynamic Log File Management
Since you fixed the Log4j initialization, the next failure point can be when
two consumers run simultaneously (e.g., on a shared Jenkins agent).
They will both try to write to the exact same log file path, which causes concurrency errors.

The Solution: Unique Log File Names
Ensure your LOG_FILE_NAME property is dynamic by appending a unique identifier,
like the current timestamp or a UUID, when the framework initializes.

In your FrameworkInitializer.init():
// Inside FrameworkInitializer.init()
String originalFileName = ConfigReader.getStrProp("LOG_FILE_NAME");
String uniqueFileName = originalFileName.replace(".log", "_" + System.currentTimeMillis() + ".log");

// Now set the dynamic property
System.setProperty("log4j2.fileName", uniqueFileName);

This simple change ensures that every test execution, even if run in parallel,
generates its own distinct log file, eliminating file access conflicts.

2] Do not use System.err.println() in catch blocks / find out something better
